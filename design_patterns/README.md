# Notes on Design Patterns

This repo represents my learning on design patterns using Ruby. The tough thing about studying design patterns is that reading about design patterns feels too abstract to mean a whole lot. Wanting to cement my learning, I challenged myself to make a small trivial example modeling each pattern, and then (just as important) writing a little something about them. Yes, there are plenty of other examples out there, but these examples were thought up by me, and, as a result I now understand the patterns and when I might want to use them, better than if I had simply read about them.
